        All Clarity attendees, speakers, performers, patrons, and volunteers are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.

      %h2.subheader The Condensed Version

      :markdown
        Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from Clarity without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

      :markdown
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

        Exception: Discussion or images related to sex, pornography, discriminatory language, or similar is welcome if it meets all of the following criteria:

        1. The organizers have specifically granted permission in writing.
        2. It is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists.
        3. It is presented in a respectful manner.
        4. Attendees are warned in advance and respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand.

        This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.

        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

        If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning  the offender to immediately expelling the offender from Clarity with no refund.

        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being  harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organizers, a member of security, or one of the Clarity volunteers immediately. All members of staff can be identified immediately by their "Staff" branded Clarity t-shirts, and will be trained in how to address and report any incidences that participants bring to their attention. All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.

        Clarity staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

        We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and Clarity-related social events.

        Thanks
