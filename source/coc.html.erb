      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>Last updated: October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015, 10:36pm PST.</p>
      <p>
        All Clarity attendees, speakers, performers, patrons, and volunteers are
        required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will
        enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
        participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.
      </p>
      <h2>The Condensed Version</h2>
      <p>
        Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
        for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability,
        physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We
        do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language
        and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, parties,
        Twitter, and other online media. Participants violating these rules may
        be sanctioned or expelled from Clarity without a refund at the
        discretion of the organizers.
      </p>
      <h2>The Less Condensed Version</h2>
      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
        religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
        stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
        disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
        unwelcome sexual attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exception: Discussion or images related to sex, pornography,
        discriminatory language, or similar is welcome if it meets all of the
        following criteria:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The organizers have specifically granted permission in writing.</li>
        <li>
          It is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists.
        </li>
        <li>It is presented in a respectful manner.</li>
        <li>
          Attendees are warned in advance and respectfully given ample warning
          and opportunity to leave beforehand.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual
        images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the
        organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the
        offender to immediately expelling the offender from Clarity with no
        refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organizers, a
        member of security, or one of the Clarity volunteers immediately. All
        members of staff can be identified immediately by their “Staff” branded
        Clarity t-shirts, and will be trained in how to address and report any
        incidences that participants bring to their attention. All reports will
        be handled in the strictest confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarity staff will be happy to help participants contact local law
        enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
        harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues
        and Clarity-related social events.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks</p>
