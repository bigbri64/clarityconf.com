Anna Pickard has spent a long time pretending to be other people. After 
training as an actor, and then segueing into dramaturgy when she realised she 
was too shy to act, she went from a small blog into a series of frankly 
ridiculous career moves: candle making, script editing, TV criticism, 
advertising, and the games industry. For [Glitch], a beloved but now-shuttered 
MMO, she gave voice to strange butterflies and surfer pigs; for Wieden+Kennedy 
she brought life to criminal cat masterminds and omniscient butter gods; for 
educational games studios, she turned mathematical concepts into friendly 
faces.

Now, as the Editorial Director at [Slack], she's pretending to be a competent 
grown-up professional. One in charge of bringing a human approach to business, 
and maintaining the energy, entertainment, values and voice of the fastest 
growing piece of business software ever.
