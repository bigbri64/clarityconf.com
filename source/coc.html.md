<p class="lead">
  All Clarity attendees, speakers, performers, patrons, and volunteers are
  required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will
  enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
  participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.
</p>

## The Condensed Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate
harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any venue, including talks, parties, Twitter, and other online
media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
Clarity without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

## The Less Condensed Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Exception: Discussion or images related to sex, pornography, discriminatory
language, or similar is welcome if it meets all of the following criteria:

1. The organizers have specifically granted permission in writing.
2. It is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists.
3. It is presented in a respectful manner.
4. Attendees are warned in advance and respectfully given ample warning and
   opportunity to leave beforehand.

This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as
attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning  the offender to
immediately expelling the offender from Clarity with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being  harassed, or
have any other concerns, please contact one of the organizers, a member of
security, or one of the Clarity volunteers immediately. All members of staff
can be identified immediately by their "Staff" branded Clarity t-shirts, and
will be trained in how to address and report any incidences that participants
bring to their attention. All reports will be handled in the strictest
confidence.

Clarity staff will be happy to help participants contact local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and
Clarity-related social events.

Thanks
