title: Help Create Clarity
---

So, we have something we're super excited about. We are currently creating our
first conference here in San Francisco about one of our favorite things --
Style Guides!

Our topics will range from content/documentation, design, development,
frameworks, accessibility, etc. We're still in early planning stages, so more
details will be coming soon. Some things we already know:

* We are planning for a 2 day event -- March 31st–April 1st, 2016. We know
  that's a year from now, but that gives us about a year to create a killer
  experience!
* We are curating the speakers around the various topics mentioned above.
* We are prioritizing diversity in our speaker selections.
* We will have and enforce a Code of Conduct.
* The two-day event will be a single track.

Some speakers who have already confirmed:

* Cordelia McGee-Tubb
* Brad Frost
* Jeremy Perez-Cruz

And our master of ceremonies is the legendary Chris Coyier!

We love your company and we'd love to have you as a sponsor to help make our
event amazing. Here are some benefits:

* Your brand will be seen by top-notch speakers in the industry. We will have
  many opportunities for logo placement.

* The event will be attended by designers, developers, content writers, and
  other industry-related people -- people you perhaps may be recruiting?

Here’s what we’ll need sponsorships for:

* Speaker compensation & travel expenses
* Speaker gift bag
* Speaker Dinner
* Event space rental
* After party
* Attendee conference bag/materials
* Food & Drinks during event
* We are also open to other sponsorship opportunities (fun contests,
  giveaways, etc).

So what do you think? We hope you're as excited as we are about our inaugural
event! Please don't hesitate to ask us any questions!
