Brandon Ferrua is a Senior Developer working on the Design Systems team at 
[Salesforce UX][ux]. His focus is on architecting scalable CSS for the 
[Lightning Design System][ds]. His previous hats have included creative 
director, designer and front-end developer for both large and small companies. 
Though the roles have changed, through them all, patterns, style guides, and 
performance remain his passions. When he is not trying to reverse-engineer all 
the things, he is a bonafide metalhead, a dog whisperer, and an avid 
outdoorsman --- code for, "he gets hurt a lot".
